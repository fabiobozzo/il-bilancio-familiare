# Il bilancio familiare
=====================

This project is a simple expense tracking software. 
I developed it for learning purposes, but actually it is fully functional and ready to use.

You can use it to keep track of your personal financial situation, tracking incomes and outcomes, 
and having a detailed reporting dashboard. 

Keeping track of your activities is always a good but boring habit. The solution is to have a tool 
that makes accomplishing this task easy and flexible.
