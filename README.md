# Il bilancio familiare

This project is a simple expense tracking software. 
I developed it for learning purposes, ntsevertheless it is fully functional and ready to be used effectively.

You can use the app to keep track of personal financial situation, record incomes and outcomes, and get detailed reports.

Tracking daily expenses is a good and boring habit. 
I designed this tool to make that task easy and flexible.

## Features

* 'Classic' login + social networks authentication
* Basic transaction registration ( in / out )
* Transactions reporting by date and category
* 'Day 0' balance calculation
* Goals (work in progress)

## Technology

Il bilancio familiare runs on Node.js platform, and uses MongoDB as its storage engine.
Everybody can run the app, that's very easy! Just edit 'mongoUri' app.js with you Mongo instance endpoint uri and launch it with 'node app.js'.
